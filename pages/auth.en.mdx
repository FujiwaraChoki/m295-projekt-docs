# Authentificitaion & Authorization

## Authentication

### What is Authentication?

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or process. Authentication is commonly performed by submitting a user name or ID and one or more items of private information that only a given user should know.

### What did we use for authentication?

We merely compared the incoming password, which was provided to us by the client side,
with the correct password (since there only is one). 

### How did we implement it?

We implemented it something like this:

```javascript
if (clientPassword === 'correctP@ss123!') {
    res.status(200).send('Login was successful! ✔️');
} else {
    res.status(401).send('Wrong password! ❌');
}
```
