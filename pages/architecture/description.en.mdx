# Description

This project is to achieve the following goals:
* Stable & secure backend for task management.
* Simple and intuitive API
* Easy integration with other projects

# Technologies

To achieve these goals, we decided to use the following technologies:
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) as runtime
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/) as a web framework

**Node.js** is a JavaScript runtime that allows JavaScript to be executed outside of the browser. This allows us to use JavaScript on the server as well.

**Express** is a web framework for Node.js that allows us to create web servers quickly and easily.
