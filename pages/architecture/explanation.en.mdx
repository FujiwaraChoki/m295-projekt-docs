# Explanation

The ToDo backend project stores the ToDo list in an array in the server's RAM. No database is required as the number of ToDos is limited and the system does not need to perform complex queries or operations. Each ToDo object in the array contains information such as the ToDo's ID, Title, Description, Due Date, and Status. The ID is generated automatically and is unique for each ToDo. The status of the ToDo can either be "done" or "pending".
